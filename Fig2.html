    For humidity, you see that all latitudes have 100% humidity readings, which makes sense because you will have precipitation at all latitudes.  At the other extreme, you only have 0% humidity at the high latitudes because air is only that dry at extremet latitudes.  Note that there are no readings at the South Pole so the data is only available at the South Pole.
