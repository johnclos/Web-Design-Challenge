    The wind speeds are fairly uniform with latitude, but at higher latitudes, it increases.  As with humidity, there is not any data below -60 degrees so we don't know if this is true in the Southern Hemisphere.  This increase in the Northern Hemisphere is likely due to this is where most weather occurs, especially violent storms such as tornadoes and hurricanes.
